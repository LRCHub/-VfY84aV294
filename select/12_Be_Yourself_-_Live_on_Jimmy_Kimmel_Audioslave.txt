Someone falls to pieces
Sleeping all alone
Someone kills the pain
Spinning in the silence
To finally drift away

Someone gets excited
In a chapel yard
Catches a bouquet
Another lays a dozen
White roses on a grave
Yeah ...

To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do

Someone finds salvation in everyone
Another only pain
Someone tries to hide himself
Down inside himself he prays

Someone swears his true love
Until the end of time
Another runs away
Separate or united
Healthy or insane?

To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do

Even when you've paid enough
Been pulled apart or been held up
With every single memory of
The good or bad faces of luck
Don't lose any sleep tonight
I'm sure everything
Will end up alright
You may win or lose

But to be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
To be yourself is all that you can do
Be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can
Be yourself is all that you can do
