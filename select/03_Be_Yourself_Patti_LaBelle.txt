Listen, all you people
Don't you be fooled by what you see
There is no rule
There is no reason
All you can be what they want you to be

'Cause everybody's got a heart that knows the truth
Oh yes you do now
You can't be nobody else, no

Be yourself
You gotta be yourself
Got to, Got to, Got to be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself
Why should you deceive yourself?
Got to, Got to, Got to be yourself
You can't be no one else

And when you love you love somebody
For what they are, not what you need
Invisible communication
Feeds the motion so naturally

'Cause everybody's got a heart that knows the truth
Tryin' to tell you
You can't be nobody else, no

You got to be yourself
You got to be yourself
You got to be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself
Why should you deceive yourself?
Got to, Got to, Got to be yourself
You can't be no one else

You know what you've got to do (feet on the ground, don't you give it up, both feet on the ground)
Keep your feet on the ground
Don't let nothin' turn you around (k-k-keep your feet on the ground, don't you give it up, both feet on the ground)
(K-k-keep your feet on the ground, don't you give it up, both feet on the ground)
(K-k-keep your feet on the ground, don't you give it up, both feet on the ground)
Invisible communication
(When you love you love somebody for what they are not what you need)
Just love
(Why should you deceive yourself?)
There is no reason
Be yourself

Gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta be yourself
You got to be yourself
Be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself
Why should you deceive yourself?
Be yourself
You can't be no one else

Be yourself
You gotta be yourself
Why should you deceive yourself?
You can't be no one else
Be yourself
You gotta be yourself
Be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself
You got to be yourself
Be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself
You got to be yourself
Be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself
You got to be yourself
Be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself (keep your feet on the ground)
Be yourself (both feet on the ground)
Be yourself
You can't be no one else
Be yourself (keep your feet on the ground)
You got to be yourself (both feet on the ground)
Be yourself
You can't be no one else
