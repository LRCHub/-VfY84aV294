[00:34.48] Someone falls to pieces sleeping all alone
[00:39.63] Someone kills the pain
[00:42.82] Spinning in the silence, she finally drifts away
[01:06.82] 
[00:51.03] Someone gets excited in a chapel yard
[00:56.08] And catches a bouquet
[00:59.13] Another lays a dozen white roses on a grave, yeah
[01:23.63] 
[01:08.20] And to be yourself is all that you can do, hey
[01:16.53] To be yourself is all that you can do
[01:35.03] 
[01:34.33] Someone finds salvation in everyone
[01:39.58] Another only pain
[01:42.87] Someone tries to hide himself down inside himself, he prays
[02:12.37] 
[01:50.95] Someone swears his true love until the end of time
[01:56.09] Another runs away
[01:59.33] Separate or united, healthy or insane
[02:17.83] 
[02:06.37] And to be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do), hey
[02:14.96] To be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
[02:23.15] To be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do), hey
[02:31.73] Be yourself is all that you can do
[02:48.73] 
[03:12.95] And even when you've paid enough
[03:16.24] Been pulled apart or been held up
[03:21.20] With every single memory of
[03:24.26] The good or bad faces of luck
[03:29.27] Don't lose any sleep tonight
[03:31.91] I'm sure everything will end up alright
[03:37.38] You may win or lose
[03:46.88] 
[03:40.05] But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
[03:48.31] To be yourself is all that you can do, oh
[03:56.13] To be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do), hey
[04:04.41] To be yourself is all that you can do (all that you can do)
[04:33.91] 
[04:12.47] To be yourself is all that you can
[04:17.30] Be yourself is all that you can
[04:21.09] Be yourself is all that you can do
